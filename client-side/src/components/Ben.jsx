              Current Amazon Learning Ambassador and former research biologist
              of 15 years. A natural problem solver with strong analytical
              abilities and a long track record of highly motivated,
              independently managed work. A jack-of-all-trades who is as
              comfortable poring over data sets from a desk as they are leading
              a team of workers on a warehouse floor.
